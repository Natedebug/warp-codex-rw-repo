# Warp Change Log

Warp should append a new section for every batch of edits so Codex can review them easily.

Template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ — short title
- Files touched: path1, path2
- Summary: brief explanation of what was changed and why
- Validation: commands run (if any) and their outcomes
```

Keep the newest entries at the top for quick scanning.
