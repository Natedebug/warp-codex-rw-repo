# CODEX.md

Instructions for Codex CLI when working in this repository:

1. Review every change made by Warp (start with `reports/warp-changes.md`) and clearly explain the differences to the user.
2. If any change contains errors, enumerate them, describe why each is incorrect, and offer options to fix them.
3. Perform edits on a copy of the original file; move the original into a subfolder (for example, `backups/<date>/filename`) so it remains available for future reference (`scripts/backup.sh` automates this).
4. Follow the shared workflow summarized in `README.md` and keep `WARP.md` up to date if expectations for Warp change.
